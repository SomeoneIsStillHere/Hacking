# Password-less SSH login via id_rsa

    This rubber ducky script enables you to turn on ssh on the victims device,
    makes an id_rsa for the user and sends it via curl to netcat listener

    ❌  -  issues with turning on shh (needs password)

    ✔️  -  listener sends id_rsa correctly
    ✔️  -  Fast
    ✔️  -  successfully makes and initializes id_rsa
    ✔️  -  the attack needs to know the shh username
